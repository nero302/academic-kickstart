Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Ivan Simpson-Kent and I'm a PhD candidate in the Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics lab (led by Rogier Kievit) at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit (University of Cambridge) where I conduct research in developmental cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, I use statistical models (e.g. structual equation models & network science) to understand how the brain and behavior interact from childhood to early adulthood to produce intelligence (e.g. working memory & fluid intelligence). After my PhD, I plan to apply insights from my research to help guide education policy, especially for disadvantaged youth struggling to learn in school. Before coming to Cambridge, I was a Fulbright scholar in Regensburg Germany, researching entomology (ants/myrmecology) and studied at the University of Scranton where I majored in neuroscience and philosopy with a minor in mathematics. West Philadelphia born and raised. He/They (h+)
